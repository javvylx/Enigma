# Enigma


## Introduction
The solution is aimed at providing as much information within the forensic bailiwick of an investigation. Our solution consists of 2 main categories, hardware and software. Under hardware, we will be utilizing the already pre-existing BashBunny to dump out the host machineâ€™s RAM data and Event Logs, which will then be analyzed by our software solutions. <br>

The software category consists of a trilogy of modules - a Windows Security Event Log analyzer, a PE static analyzer, and automated RAM analysis. The solution will also contain a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to not only ease navigation and interaction between modules, but also to display the results in a concise manner for investigators to follow up. This GUI is designed for user-friendliness to ease the job of newer/less experienced investigators, while allowing the user to have a clear overview of their task-at-hand.<br>
