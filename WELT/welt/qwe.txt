To change to test in your env:

 

Analysis.ps1:

$n - don’t need to bother, its inside the WELT2 file

$f – change to the full path of testlog.xml, can just put in desktop

 

Testing:

If you want you can test EQ, OR, RP

Spoof the event ids, meaning see the ruleset, which Event ID will trigger the rule , then change the EventID field in the testlog jiukeyile

 

How I test:

Cd C:\Users\cleav\Desktop\WELT2    #do in the welt directory

.\Analysis.ps1

 

AND:

Up to u to see how you wanna do it, currently my way very troublesome.

 

Old code is obsolete, but can use as reference even though we don’t know what we did monkaGiga

 

 

So for AND and SEQ,

These 2 are related, how you do AND will be how you do SEQ, just that SEQ MUST BE IN S E Q U E N C E

 



dumping just run the script and write the params i got document the params

then the sec log that was dumped put to desktop.

go into analysis.ps1

change $f to the fullpath of the dump

change $casefile (iirc) to the name of the folder u want

then run analysis.ps1



format:
{details:[{"event_id":"1", 
        "time":"1200",
        "EventID": "xxxx",
        "Comments": "this means that your mother die"},
      {"event_id":"1",
